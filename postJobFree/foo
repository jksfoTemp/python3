Thought you might enjoy these ...

This one is of a drone show by the Oakland-Bay Bridge All-star weekend (Basketball) - all of the lights in the design are from drones that are programmed to move in formation:

It was about half a mile a way. No, I did not get to see it in person but still really impressive.


This one was for Chinese New Year celebration (lasts a month, just finished), the Salesforce Tower and the TransAmerica put on displays in synchronicity:

About a mile and a quarter mile away; did not see it - sometimes one forgets to look up!
