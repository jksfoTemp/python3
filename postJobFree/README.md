git status head detached trying to push to dev branch


Git Detached Head Error
When you encounter a "HEAD detached" state in Git and want to push changes to a development branch, you can follow these steps:

Create a New Branch: First, create a new branch from the current commit to attach your changes to a branch. This can be done with the command:
  git checkout -b new-feature
This command creates a new branch named new-feature and switches to it, effectively reattaching your HEAD to a branch.
Push Changes: Once you are on the new branch, you can push your changes to the remote repository:
  git push origin new-feature
This will push the branch to your remote repository, so the branch will be tracked and stored remotely.
Merge into Development Branch: If you need to merge these changes into an existing development branch, switch to the development branch and merge the new branch into it:
  git checkout dev
  git merge new-feature
After merging, you can push the changes to the remote development branch:
  git push origin dev
Alternative Method: If you want to directly push your changes to the remote development branch without creating a new branch, you can use:
  git push origin HEAD:dev
This command pushes the current commit to the dev branch on the remote repository.
By following these steps, you can resolve the detached HEAD state and successfully push your changes to the development branch.
