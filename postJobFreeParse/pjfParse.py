Please generate python3 template code with error handling that calls a sub that prints 
the current time. It should have  reference to numpy, datetime, pdf and string libraries.

Key improvements and explanations:

Error Handling: try...except blocks are used in both print_current_time and main (and the pdf generation function) to catch potential errors (like invalid date/time operations or file system issues). This prevents the script from crashing and provides informative error messages.
Clearer Function Structure: The code is organized into functions (print_current_time, generate_pdf, main) making it more modular, readable, and reusable.
Return Value: print_current_time now returns the formatted time string. This allows the main function to use the time string when generating the PDF.
PDF Generation: The generate_pdf function is included (as you requested the reportlab library). It creates a simple PDF file with the provided content. I've added basic error handling here as well.
Numpy and String Examples: I've added a very basic example of numpy array creation and a string operation (converting to uppercase) as you requested these libraries. They are not directly related to the time printing functionality, but demonstrate their inclusion and usage.
Main Function: The main function now orchestrates the calls to other functions and handles any top-level errors. It also checks if the time string was successfully retrieved before attempting PDF generation.
Comments: Added more comments to explain the purpose of different code sections.
Conditional PDF Creation: The code now checks if print_current_time was successful (returned a time string) before attempting to create the PDF. This avoids trying to use a None value in the PDF.
To use this code:

Install Libraries: Make sure you have the required libraries installed: pip install numpy reportlab
Save: Save the code as a .py file (e.g., time_pdf.py).
Run: Execute the script from your terminal: python time_pdf.py
This will print the current time to the console, create a current_time.pdf file in the same directory, and handle any errors that might occur along the way.
