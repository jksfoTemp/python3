How to debug, with vscode (hosted on linux), a python module (file) (that
parses) that takes command line arguments ... should have been simple.

After hours spent with (AI's, articles, docs and youtube) ...

TLDR: [ctrl] [shift] [d]

In launch.json (create one if it doesn't exist), add node (the second node here,
in the same directory as the script/module) that defines the argument(s).

For example:

{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
            {
              "type": "bashdb",
              "request": "launch",
              "name": "Bash-Debug (simplest configuration)",
              "program": "${file}"
            },
    {
      "name": "Python: Current File",
      "type": "debugpy",
      "request": "launch",
      "program": "${file}",
      "args": [
        "www.cnn.com"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

(Save/close)

Set a breakpoint in your code

Enter [ctrl] [shift] [d]

Look for the green triangle pointing right (in the top left for me)

Hit the 'down arrow' and select the correct debugger ("Python Debugger: Current
file with arguments")

Hit 'play' (the green arrow)

The palette box (top) will prompt you for the arguments; enter one at a time
and hit enter after each

Assuming your conde actually parses correctly (start with something simple), you
should be able to ([f9][f10][f11]) through it like normal ([f5] to run it all).

If something 'burps', close the IDE (vscode), reopen it and start again.

python3 ./wget2/getRequest.2.py "cnn.com"

python3 -m pdb ./wget2/getRequest.2.py "cnn.com"

$ python3 -m pdb app.py arg1 arg2


Alternatively, if you are using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), you can configure your launch settings in the launch.json file to include command line arguments. For instance, you can set "args": ["arg1", "arg2"] in your launch configuration to pass arguments to your script when debugging.

vscode launch.json file syntax for including two command line arguments?
