"""
Key Improvements and Explanations:

Handles Different Image Formats: The code now checks the file extension and 
uses the appropriate save method for JPEG, PNG, GIF and WebP images. It 
also includes basic error handling for unsupported formats.

PNG Optimization: PNGs are now also optimized using optimize=True in the 
save() method. PNG optimization is lossless.

GIF and WebP Support: Added basic support for GIF and WebP. GIF compression 
has limitations. WebP offers a good balance between size and quality.

Directory Processing: The process_directory function makes it easy to 
reduce all images within a given directory. It also creates the output 
directory if it doesn't already exist.

Error Handling: The try...except block handles potential errors, such as the 
file not being found or other exceptions during image processing. This makes 
the code more robust.

Quality Parameter: The quality parameter allows you to control the compression 
level for JPEG images. Lower values result in smaller file sizes but 
potentially lower image quality. This parameter is also used for WebP.

Preserve Directory Structure: The example code now shows how to use os.walk 
and os.path.relpath to process images in a directory and keep the same 
directory structure in the output directory. This is very useful when 
dealing with many images organized in folders.

How to Use:

Install Pillow (PIL): If you don't have it already, install the Pillow 
library: pip install Pillow

Save the Code: Save the code as a Python file (e.g., reduce_images.py).

Run the Script:

Single Image: Modify the reduce_image_size example at the bottom of the 
script with the correct input and output paths, and then run the 
script: python reduce_images.py

Directory: Modify the process_directory example with the input and output 
directory paths, and then run the script.

Directory with Subfolders: Modify the os.walk example with the input and 
output directory paths, and then run the script.

Important Notes:

JPEG Quality: Experiment with the quality parameter to find a good balance 
between file size and image quality. Values between 70 and 90 are often a 
good starting point.

File Formats: JPEG is a lossy compression format (some image data is 
discarded), so the quality will be reduced. PNG is lossless (all image 
data is preserved), but PNG files are often larger than JPEGs, except 
when the image has large areas of the same color. WebP can be lossy or 
lossless.

Large Images: For very large images, you might want to consider resizing 
them before reducing the quality to further decrease file size. PIL provides 
functions for resizing as well.

WebP: WebP is a modern image format that offers excellent compression. If 
you're targeting web use, converting to WebP is usually a good idea. You 
can use the provided code to convert your images to WebP.
